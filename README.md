# ray-casting-game
A simple 2D game where the player scores points by shining light on ghosts. 

The game was built using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/) and was heavily inspired by [The Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain).

## How to play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the light source.

The aim of the game is to shine light on the ghost. Once you shine light on one ghost, it disappears and a new one for you to catch reappears in a separate part of the map. 

You traverse the course using the arrow keys, but you can't pass through walls. However, the ghost has an upper hand on you, as it can pass through walls!

## Tips
* The walls in the map are generated randomly. You can generate a new map by refreshing the page once you're playing the game (if you feel like one map is particularly difficult!)
* Since the ghost moves randomly, it's sometimes better to wait for the ghost to come to you, illuminating parts of the map it might head to, rather than chasing it. 
* Good luck!
